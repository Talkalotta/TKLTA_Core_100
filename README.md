# TKLTA Core 100

This repository contains **TKLTA Core 100**, a multilingual collection of short sentence sets compiled by Talkalotta. Each CSV file holds around one hundred examples for a specific language or dialect. The data is useful for studying common sentence structures and everyday conversation across languages.

## Dataset structure

The corpus consists of files named `TKLTA_<CODE>_100.csv`, where `<CODE>` identifies the language. Every file uses comma‑separated values with a header row followed by about 100 entries. The columns are:

- `Category` – the type of example. Typical categories include:
  - **Grammar Core** – sentences illustrating key grammar or verb tenses
  - **Conversational Data** – snippets of natural dialogue
  - **Paraphrased & Augmented Sentences** – alternative phrasings and variations
- A second column containing the sentence text in the relevant language.

Some files use native scripts or region‑specific orthographies. Lines may not be strictly normalized, so minor formatting differences are expected.

These datasets are provided "as is" without warranty. They are intended for language learning, linguistics research, and natural language processing experiments.
